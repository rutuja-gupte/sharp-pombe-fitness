# Effects of Mutations in Haploid and Diploid Fission Yeast

Understanding the effects of mutations is essential for understanding how genomes evolve. This study explored the relationship between mutations and fitness under different ploidies in fission yeast. A mutation accumulation (MA) setup, that results in the fate of mutations being primarily determined by genetic drift rather than natural selection, was used to generate lines with multiple generations of spontaneous mutations. The fitness of these MA lines was compared to the fitness of their ancestors. Thus, this study explores an important evolutionary relationship and indicates that ploidy influences the effects of mutations on fitness.
